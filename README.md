# Kendi J 
 
I’m a Flutter developer, game app tinkerer, and community builder. I develop beautiful mobile apps with Flutter & Firebase, explore the backend with Go and GCP, and organize FlutterCon Kenya to grow dev talent across Africa. Oh — and I’m a mountain lover with big dreams and an even bigger to-build list.
